@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 Cash Flows in Equilibrium Asset Pricing Models @@
@@mb-0 Draft coming soon.@@
I propose a method to model cash flows in macrofinance asset pricing models in a manner that respects equilibrium market clearing and matches the timing and nature of cash flow risk, while preserving solution tractability. The method models dividends as the residual piece of consumption following labor income. It is parsimonious, leaves the pricing kernel unchanged, and is broadly applicable across a wide class of models. I show that modifying leading asset pricing models to use my proposed method for cash flows allows the models to replicate the salient facts on cash flow growth and recent term structure evidence from securities markets which were previously counterfactual.

<!-- I propose a way to model the cash flows in consumption-based asset pricing models that allows cash flows to have dynamic properties distinct from that of consumption. The method models dividends as the residual piece of consumption following labor income. The modification is parsimonious in that it adds only 4 parameters, it relies on observable economic moments as opposed to unobservable latent state variables, and it is economically motivated. When embedded into existing asset pricing models, the models are able to reproduce a number of salient facts about macroeconomic series, including the term structures of growth rate volatility and co-movement. The approach provides richer asset pricing dynamics  and also sheds light on the role that non-financial wealth plays in the pricing of financial assets. -->

We use options and return data to decompose unconditional risk premia
into different parts of the return state space. In the data, the entire equity
premium is attributable to monthly returns below -11.3%, but returns in the
extreme left tail matter very little. In contrast, leading asset pricing models
based on habits, long-run risks, and rare disasters attribute the premium almost
exclusively to returns above -11.3%, or to the extreme left tail. We find
that model extensions with a larger quantity of tail risk cannot account for
the data, while models with a higher price of tail risk can.

@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 The Anatomy of Trading Algorithms @@
@@mb-0 with [Sunil Wahal](https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/sunil-wahal). [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3497001) _Submitted_ @@
We study the anatomy of four widely used institutional trading algorithms representing \$675 billion in demand from 961 institutions between 2012 and 2016. Parent orders generate hundreds of child orders which strategically employ price, time-in-force, and display priority rules to navigate the tradeoff between the desire to trade and minimizing transaction costs. Child orders incur price impact at the time they are submitted to the book regardless of whether or not they are (ex post) filled, and even when passively priced relative to the prevailing quote. The intra-parent distribution of child orders is non-random, generating strategic runs which oscillate between the aggressive or passive side of the spread. Despite algorithmic attempts to reduce their influence, programmatic child-level price, time-in-force, and display choices aggregate up to parent-level trading costs borne by investors. 


@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 Heterogeneity and Household Portfolio Choice @@
@@mb-0 Revised draft coming soon. @@
I study the distributional properties of household risky shares, the fraction of their financial portfolio allocated to risky assets. Many proposed solutions to bring household life-cycle portfolio choice models in line with the average risky share, such as participation costs or differences in labor income risk profiles, fall far short of generating sufficient cross-sectional heterogeneity in portfolio allocations at nearly every point in the life-cycle.

@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 The Mathematics of Saving @@
@@mb-0  Draft coming soon.@@
I provide a new perspective on the process of repeated saving using financial products with potentially uncertain rates of return, such as savings, brokerage, or retirement accounts. A financial account can be viewed as a portfolio of investments in _itself_ with differing _horizon_ -- it follows that standard portfolio theory applies. The analysis makes extensive use of moment generating functions, and I pursue two approaches for tractability. I first develop a novel iterative algorithm for computing multivariate moment generating functions, while the second approach exploits a truncated moment generating function approximation. I discuss the benefits of this framework for financial planners and policymakers, how it relates to current modeling techniques, and possible extensions to multiple assets and uncertain savings amounts.

We use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to produce solutions of an agent-based, rate equation model of an informationally efficient, closed financial market. The simulations produce a crash in the market that is forewarned through the observation of a market instability from which the market temporarily recovers. The market remained in a quasi-stable state for a relatively large amount of time between the warning and the crash, raising the prospect that some mitigating action can be taken in time to avert the impending crash. This result has strong ramifications for the future of predicting calamitous market events, especially if some observable aspect of financial markets can be positively identified and associated with simulation parameters.
