# About Me


My research interests include studying financial markets in the large and in the small. 

* Asset Pricing
* Tail Risk
* Macrofinance
* Algorithmic Trading
* Computational Finance

I maintain a public Call For Papers [calendar](https://tbeason.com/financeconferences) that might interest you.

My wife and I enjoy spending our free time entertaining our son and getting outside when we can. Things I want to brag about but decided against putting on my CV: (1) completed multiple marathons, (2) won a few amateur ballroom dancing awards (credit due to my beautiful dancing partner), and (3) good listener.

In Fall 2021 I will be joining the Pamplin College of Business at Virginia Tech as Assistant Professor of Finance and Russell & Arlene Oliver Junior Faculty Fellow.
